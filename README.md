# Simple Shell
Simple Shell is a basic UNIX command line interpreter written in C. It provides a minimalist shell environment where users can execute commands interactively or from a file.

## Features
- Interactive mode: Users can enter commands interactively in the shell prompt.
- Non-interactive mode: Commands can be executed from a file provided as an argument.
- Error handling: Provides informative error messages for command execution failures and file errors.
- Supports simple commands: Executes one-word commands without arguments.

## Usage
### Interactive Mode
To run the shell in interactive mode, simply execute the compiled binary:
```bash
./hsh
